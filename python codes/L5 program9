#pass statement:-

for i in range(5):
    pass #empty

if i >5:
    pass

print("some useful work")#therefore;pass statement is needed



# PRACTICE QUESTION
#1. wap to find sum of first n nos (using while)
n=5
sum=0
i=1
while i <=n:
    sum+=1
    i+=1

print("total sum =",sum)

#2. WAP to find factorial of first n numbers(using for )

n=5
fact=1

for i in range(1,n+1):
    fact+=1

print("factorial is =",fact)
